### Prerequisites

For Advanced Users, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Star & Fork Repo
- Get Your Session ID
- Put Your Session ID in `session/cred.json` file


## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will automatically connect to WhatsApp and start handling messages based on the predefined commands and handlers. You can customize and add new functionalities by editing the `commands` directory.

## Adding Commands

#### To create your custom new command:

1. Create a new file in the `plugins` directory, for example `hi.js`.
2. Define the command logic using the following template:
    ```javascript
    import amd from './lib';
    
    amd(
      {
        pattern: "hi", // The Command Name
        alias: "hello" // Command Secondary Trigger
        fromMe: true, // is the message from the owner
        desc: "Send Hi Message", // Command Description
        type: "Test", // Command Category
      },
      async (message) => {
        await message.send("Hello There");
      }
    );
    ```

3. Ensure that your new command file is correctly imported and utilized within your main bot setup. **Apply at your own end**
